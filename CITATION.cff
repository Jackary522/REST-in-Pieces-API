  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are pivotal in
  the development of modern cloud and web applications,
  facilitating expansive growth and integration
  capabilities. However, this ubiquity also introduces a
  significant array of security threats. This project delves
  into an analysis of the predominant security
  vulnerabilities within Representational State Transfer
  (RESTful) APIs, a method widely adopted due to its
  simplicity and seamless HTTP integration. Beginning with
  an overview of RESTful APIsâ€™ structure and principles,
  this study establishes a foundational understanding
  necessary for exploring the security vulnerabilities
  inherent in these systems. Subsequently, the focus shifts
  to examining the most common security issues as identified
  by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)
  in 2021, which include broken access control,
  cryptographic failures, and various forms of injection
  attacks, with a special emphasis on insecure design
  practices. To bridge theory with practice, a custom API
  developed in JavaScript and executed on Node.js is
  utilized to illustrate these vulnerabilities through
  real-world scenarios. Documented and hosted on GitHub,
  this API not only demonstrates the discussed security
  flaws but also serves as a practical resource for
  understanding their impact. Ultimately, this paper aims to
  enhance awareness of these vulnerabilities, proposing
  effective mitigation strategies and promoting best
  practices to secure RESTful APIs against emerging security
  threats.
